Hi Folks,
I'm Kevin Joe Harris, DevOps Engineer with over 2+ years of experience. I have created this repository to help new DevOps learners to understand core concepts. This repository contains solutions for tasks and challenges from KodeKloud Engineer.
The goal of this repo is to:
Help learners understand why a solution works, not just what to type
Serve as a quick reference for common Kubernetes and DevOps scenarios
Avoid common auto-grader pitfalls by following grader-safe practices

I have used the following naming scheme.
1. Each tool has it's own folder
2. The tasks are catergoried into folders based on the topic, then the level
3. You can find the task name from the Commit message!

Please try on your own first and refer if you face issues!
Happy learning!!!!
