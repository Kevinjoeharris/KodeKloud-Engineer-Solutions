Hi Folks,
I'm Kevin Joe Harris, DevOps Engineer with over 2+ years of experience. I have created this repository to help new DevOps learners to understand core concepts. This repository contains step-by-step solutions for tasks and challenges from KodeKloud Engineer.
The goal of this repo is to:
Help learners understand why a solution works, not just what to type
Serve as a quick reference for common Kubernetes and DevOps scenarios
Avoid common auto-grader pitfalls by following grader-safe practices

I have used the following naming scheme.
1. Each tool has it's own folder
2. The tasks are labelled as Example: "L1 - Task 1" which denotes Level 1 and the task number.

Please try on your own first and refer if you face issues!
Happy learning!!!!
